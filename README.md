According to Komnas Perempuan Indonesia, there were 338,496 verified reports of gender-based violence (KBG) against females throughout 2021. 
from the 2020 report which amounted to 226,062 cases as there is a facility where females are able to report easily via online platforms. Another problem that we found is a lot of females felt not safe/ashamed or even didn't feel like they were just being violenced by a certain person. 
Those feelings or mindset which then make the harasser keep doing the act.
